## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design
The application follows a clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js                    # Main application controller
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/main/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScreenCaptureManager   # Screen capture and overlay management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FileManager           # File operations and clipboard integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/renderer/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlay.html          # Fullscreen selection overlay
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preview.html          # Screenshot preview with annotation tools
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ settings.html         # Settings window with theme and shortcuts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ *-preload.js          # Secure IPC bridges for each renderer
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/shared/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.js          # Centralized configuration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ preload-utils.js      # Shared preload script utilities
```

### Key Components

**ScreenCaptureApp (main.js)**
- Main application controller with theme management
- Handles Electron lifecycle and IPC coordination
- Manages system tray, global shortcuts, and settings persistence
- Coordinates multiple preview windows and window lifecycle

**ScreenCaptureManager**
- Screen capture using Electron's `desktopCapturer`
- Overlay window management for area selection
- Multi-monitor support with combined display bounds
- App icon integration and display scaling

**FileManager**  
- Image processing with Jimp for cropping and border compositing
- Temporary file management with auto-cleanup
- Clipboard integration for images and file paths
- Save operations with user file dialogs

### Security Model
- Context isolation enabled in all renderer processes
- No node integration in renderer processes
- Secure IPC communication through contextBridge
- All file operations handled in main process

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Electron**: Desktop app framework
- **Jimp**: Image processing and cropping
- **uuid**: Unique filename generation
- **temp**: Temporary file management with tracking
- **electron-log**: Local file-based logging

### Screen Capture Process
1. User triggers capture ‚Üí `ScreenCaptureManager.startCapture()`
2. Capture all screens using `desktopCapturer.getSources()`
3. Create fullscreen overlay covering all displays
4. User selects area ‚Üí coordinates sent via IPC
5. `ScreenCaptureManager.processSelection()` crops selected area
6. `FileManager.processScreenshot()` saves and copies to clipboard
7. Preview window displays with action buttons

### Multi-Monitor Support
- Detects all displays using `screen.getAllDisplays()`
- Calculates combined bounds for overlay positioning
- Handles high DPI displays with automatic scaling
- Selection coordinates mapped to correct display

### File Management
- Screenshots saved to OS-appropriate temp directories
- UUID-based filenames prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup when preview window closes
- Optional permanent save with user-chosen location

## üéØ Claude Code Integration

This tool is specifically designed for seamless Claude Code workflows:

1. **Auto-Clipboard**: Screenshots immediately available for pasting
2. **File Path Copy**: Get absolute file paths for direct Claude Code usage
3. **Temporary Persistence**: Files remain available until window close
4. **Offline Operation**: No network dependencies, complete privacy

### Usage with Claude Code
1. Take screenshot using `Ctrl+Shift+S`
2. Image is automatically in clipboard - paste directly into Claude Code
3. Or click "Copy Path" to get file path for Claude Code file operations
4. Files auto-cleanup when done, maintaining privacy

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

### 100% Offline Operation
- **No Network Code**: Zero HTTP clients, APIs, or cloud services
- **Local Storage Only**: All data saved to local temp directories
- **No Telemetry**: No analytics, crash reporting, or external communication
- **Privacy First**: Screenshots never leave your machine

### Security Features
- Secure Electron configuration with context isolation
- No remote module access in renderer processes  
- Sandboxed renderer processes with limited API access
- All system operations handled in main process

## üì¶ Automated Builds

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform builds:

- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch
- **Platforms**: Windows and macOS builds run in parallel
- **Artifacts**: Installers automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases
- **Workflow**: See `.github/workflows/` for build configuration

### Build Requirements

#### Custom Icons (Required for Distribution)
Add these files to `/assets/` directory:
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (256x256 with multiple sizes)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (1024x1024 with Retina support)

See `assets/ICON-SETUP.md` for detailed icon creation instructions.

#### Platform-Specific Notes
- **Windows**: Creates NSIS installer with desktop shortcuts

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Global Shortcut Not Working**
- Check if another app is using `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check accessibility permissions (macOS)

**Black Screenshot/No Overlay**
- Check screen recording permissions on macOS
- Ensure no fullscreen apps are blocking overlay

**Build Fails**
- Run `npm run build:setup` first to create required assets
- Add custom icons to `/assets/` directory
- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)

**Preview Window Not Opening** 
- Check temp directory permissions
- Look in electron logs for error details
- Verify image processing dependencies installed

**Settings Window Issues**
- Try right-clicking system tray icon to access settings
- Check if settings file has correct permissions in user data directory
- Reset settings by deleting app settings file in user data folder

**Border Drawing Not Working**
- Make sure you're in border mode (click Borders button or press Ctrl+B)
- Check that you're drawing outside the toolbar area
- Try right-clicking in border mode to access color picker

**Theme Not Changing**
- Check system theme settings if using "System" theme mode
- Try manually selecting Light or Dark theme from settings
- Restart application if theme appears stuck

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs with developer tools open
```

### Logs
Application logs are stored locally using electron-log:
