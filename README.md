## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Download Pre-built Binaries
Get the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](../../releases) page:
- **Windows**: Download `.exe` installer 
- **macOS**: Download `.dmg` installer

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ScreenCapture_clean

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Or run in production mode
npm start
```

### Building Distributables
Cross-platform builds are automated via GitHub Actions. Every push to `main` triggers builds for both Windows and macOS.

**Local builds:**
```bash
# Setup build environment (creates icon placeholders)
npm run build:setup

# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for specific platforms
npm run build:win     # Windows installer (.exe)
npm run build:mac     # macOS installer (.dmg) - requires macOS
npm run build:all     # Both platforms
npm run build:portable # Windows portable app
```

Built installers will be created in the `/dist` directory.

## üéÆ Usage

### Taking Screenshots
1. **Hotkey**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` anywhere on your system
2. **Tray Icon**: Click the screenshot tool icon in your system tray
3. **Selection**: Click and drag to select the area you want to capture
4. **Preview**: The preview window opens automatically with your screenshot

### Preview Window

  - `Ctrl+S`: Save screenshot
  - `Esc`: Close preview window
- **Mouse Actions**: Click action buttons for copy/save operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Modular Design
The application follows a clean, modular architecture with separation of concerns:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js                    # Main application controller
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/main/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ScreenCaptureManager   # Screen capture and overlay management
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ FileManager           # File operations and clipboard integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/renderer/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overlay.html          # Fullscreen selection overlay
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ preview.html          # Screenshot preview window
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/shared/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ constants.js          # Centralized configuration
```

### Key Components

**ScreenCaptureApp (main.js)**
- Main application controller
- Handles Electron lifecycle and IPC coordination
- Manages system tray and global shortcuts

**ScreenCaptureManager**
- Screen capture using Electron's `desktopCapturer`
- Overlay window management for area selection
- Multi-monitor support with combined display bounds

**FileManager**  
- Image processing with Jimp for cropping
- Temporary file management with auto-cleanup
- Clipboard integration and file save operations

### Security Model
- Context isolation enabled in all renderer processes
- No node integration in renderer processes
- Secure IPC communication through contextBridge
- All file operations handled in main process

## üîß Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Electron**: Desktop app framework
- **Jimp**: Image processing and cropping
- **uuid**: Unique filename generation
- **temp**: Temporary file management with tracking
- **electron-log**: Local file-based logging

### Screen Capture Process
1. User triggers capture ‚Üí `ScreenCaptureManager.startCapture()`
2. Capture all screens using `desktopCapturer.getSources()`
3. Create fullscreen overlay covering all displays
4. User selects area ‚Üí coordinates sent via IPC
5. `ScreenCaptureManager.processSelection()` crops selected area
6. `FileManager.processScreenshot()` saves and copies to clipboard
7. Preview window displays with action buttons

### Multi-Monitor Support
- Detects all displays using `screen.getAllDisplays()`
- Calculates combined bounds for overlay positioning
- Handles high DPI displays with automatic scaling
- Selection coordinates mapped to correct display

### File Management
- Screenshots saved to OS-appropriate temp directories
- UUID-based filenames prevent conflicts
- Automatic cleanup when preview window closes
- Optional permanent save with user-chosen location

## üéØ Claude Code Integration

This tool is specifically designed for seamless Claude Code workflows:

1. **Auto-Clipboard**: Screenshots immediately available for pasting
2. **File Path Copy**: Get absolute file paths for direct Claude Code usage
3. **Temporary Persistence**: Files remain available until window close
4. **Offline Operation**: No network dependencies, complete privacy

### Usage with Claude Code
1. Take screenshot using `Ctrl+Shift+S`
2. Image is automatically in clipboard - paste directly into Claude Code
3. Or click "Copy Path" to get file path for Claude Code file operations
4. Files auto-cleanup when done, maintaining privacy

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

### 100% Offline Operation
- **No Network Code**: Zero HTTP clients, APIs, or cloud services
- **Local Storage Only**: All data saved to local temp directories
- **No Telemetry**: No analytics, crash reporting, or external communication
- **Privacy First**: Screenshots never leave your machine

### Security Features
- Secure Electron configuration with context isolation
- No remote module access in renderer processes  
- Sandboxed renderer processes with limited API access
- All system operations handled in main process

## üì¶ Automated Builds

### GitHub Actions CI/CD
This repository uses GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform builds:

- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch
- **Platforms**: Windows and macOS builds run in parallel
- **Artifacts**: Installers automatically uploaded to GitHub Releases
- **Workflow**: See `.github/workflows/` for build configuration

### Build Requirements

#### Custom Icons (Required for Distribution)
Add these files to `/assets/` directory:
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon (256x256 with multiple sizes)
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (1024x1024 with Retina support)

See `assets/ICON-SETUP.md` for detailed icon creation instructions.

#### Platform-Specific Notes
- **Windows**: Creates NSIS installer with desktop shortcuts
- **macOS**: Creates DMG with drag-to-Applications
- **Permissions**: macOS may require screen recording permissions
- **Code Signing**: GitHub Actions can be configured with signing certificates

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

### Stage 2: Enhanced Capture Modes
- Full screen capture (`Ctrl+Shift+F`)
- Freeform selection with custom shapes  
- Window selection mode
- Enhanced multi-monitor controls

### Stage 3: Screen Recording
- Video recording with area selection
- System audio and microphone capture
- Recording controls with floating panel
- MP4/WebM format support

- Cross-platform compatibility
- Clean modular architecture

### Code Style
- ES6+ JavaScript with async/await
- Modular class-based architecture
- Comprehensive error handling
- Electron security best practices

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Global Shortcut Not Working**
- Check if another app is using `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or check accessibility permissions (macOS)

**Black Screenshot/No Overlay**
- Check screen recording permissions on macOS
- Ensure no fullscreen apps are blocking overlay

**Build Fails**
- Run `npm run build:setup` first to create required assets
- Add custom icons to `/assets/` directory
- Check Node.js version (requires 18+)

**Preview Window Not Opening** 
- Check temp directory permissions
- Look in electron logs for error details
- Verify image processing dependencies installed

### Debug Mode
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs with developer tools open
```

### Logs
Application logs are stored locally using electron-log:
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\offline-screenshot-tool\logs\`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/offline-screenshot-tool/`
